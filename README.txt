A WordPress plugin that manages the subscription and administration of members. Created for bologna.cngei.it

== Description ==

The plugin was created for an italian non-profit organization to manage their yearly member subscription renewal and signup process.  
The plugin creates "member" and "member administrator" roles and should take care of new and renewing member signup process. The plugin should also be the entry point to an eco-system of plugins, created after this one, to manage and run the organization as efficiently as possible.
